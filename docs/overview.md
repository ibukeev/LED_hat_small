# Project Overview

## Introduction

This project is a wearable LED hat powered by a Pixelblaze controller, designed to create dynamic, eye-catching light patterns for events, performances, or personal expression.

## Goals

- Create a compact, wearable LED display
- Provide easy pattern customization via Pixelblaze web interface
- Ensure comfortable, long-lasting battery operation
- Maintain a clean, professional appearance

## Key Features

### Hardware
- Compact form factor suitable for hat integration
- Efficient power management for extended battery life
- Durable construction for active use
- Weather-resistant design (optional)

### Software
- WiFi-enabled pattern control
- Real-time pattern switching
- Custom pattern creation via Pixelblaze web interface
- Pattern presets for quick setup

## Use Cases

- Festivals and events
- Performances and shows
- Personal expression and art
- Group coordination and identification
- Safety and visibility

## Pattern Ideas (Rave/Techno)

Idea pool:
- Laser fan: radial beams sweeping around the hat in sync with audio peaks.
- Tachyon spiral: fast spiral bands that tighten on beats and loosen between.
- Strobe grid: alternating checker columns with audio-gated strobing.
- Hyperspace tunnel: scrolling depth cues with velocity tied to audio energy.
- Equalizer crown: vertical bars around the brim driven by audio FFT bands.
- Plasma pulse: neon blobs that bloom outward with kick detection.
- Glitch scanline: random horizontal bands that jump and invert on beats.
- Aurora rave: two-tone ribbons that sway with accelerometer tilt.
- Spark rain: top-down sparks that get denser with audio energy.
- VU ring: a circular VU meter that rises around the cylinder.
- Phosphor decay: bright bars that fade with persistence, triggered by audio hits.
- Dual helix: two opposite spirals, phase-locked to the beat.
- Shockwave ring: expanding rings from a random origin on each kick.
- Police siren remix: split-color strobe with variable duty cycle tied to BPM.
- Kaleido flip: mirror symmetry flip between segments on snare hits.
- Warp stripes: horizontal stripes that stretch with bass.
- Electro-flag mash: fast color flips with smooth decay between.
- Firefly swarm: twinkling points that orbit and surge on peaks.
- Matrix drip: vertical “rain” with beat-driven density.
- Oscilloscope wrap: waveform trace that wraps the cylinder.

Shortlist with minimal specs (40% brightness cap):
- Laser fan: angle windows, neon cyan/magenta, audio peaks add beams, global max 0.4.
- Equalizer crown: columns=FFT bands, z=height, gradient tips, cap at 0.4.
- Tachyon spiral: angle+z spiral, lime/blue, bass tightens pitch, cap 0.4.
- Glitch scanline: z bands, random jumps, snare flips, flash max 0.4.
- Hyperspace tunnel: angle streaks + z depth, purple/blue, bass density, cap 0.4.
- Shockwave ring: expanding rings, kick spawns, amber/blue, max 0.4.
- Dual helix: opposing spirals, green/magenta, energy scales width, cap 0.4.
- Spark rain: z fall, random spawns, white/blue trails, max 0.4.
- VU ring: ring height from RMS/FFT, red/yellow/white, cap 0.4.
- Aurora rave: 3D noise ribbons, teal/pink, tilt bends waves, max 0.4.
